## 🧠 How The Matching Logic Works

1. User selects ingredients.
2. Clicks **Find Recipe**.
3. The system removes common kitchen ingredients from comparison.
4. Custom filtering algorithm checks if recipe ingredients match selected items.
5. Matching recipes are displayed on the `/recipes` route.

This ensures more accurate and meaningful recipe suggestions.
